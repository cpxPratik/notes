Javascript Data Types
=====================
Javascript types do not need to be declared ahead of time and variables types can change because the type will be determined automatically when the program is being processed.


Javascript has 7 data types (as of ES6).

* `Boolean`
* `Null`
* `Undefined`
* `Number`
* `String`
* `Symbol (new in ES6)`
* `Object`

Primitive Values
----------------
Primitive values are immutable. All data types except `Object` are immutable and thus primitive in javascript.

Some primitives have special wrappers:

* `String` for the string primitive.
* `Number` for the number primitive.
* `Boolean` for the Boolean primitive.
* `Symbol` for the Symbol primitive.
